Il caffè può influire sull'ipertensione in modo differente depending on the individual. Some studies suggest that moderate caffeine consumption (200-300 mg, or about 1-2 cups of coffee) may cause a temporary increase in blood pressure, while others have found no significant effect. However, excessive caffeine consumption (more than 400 mg) can lead to an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, which can be problematic for people with pre-existing hypertension.

It's important to note that the impact of caffeine on blood pressure can vary depending on factors such as age, body weight, and individual sensitivity. Additionally, caffeine can interact with certain medications used to treat hypertension, making them less effective.

If you have concerns about your blood pressure or are experiencing symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, or shortness of breath after consuming caffeine, it's recommended that you speak with your doctor or a healthcare professional for personalized advice.""" "Il caffè può temporaneamente aumentare la pressione sanguigna. Se sei iperteso, limita il consumo di caffeina e monitora la risposta del tuo corpo. É sempre consigliabile consultare un medico per una valutazione personalizzata."
