"""Buongiorno! As a doctor, I would advise against practicing yoga or any other form of exercise during a hypertension or tachycardia episode. It is important to prioritize your health and safety during these conditions. However, I would recommend consulting with a medical professional before starting any new exercise routine, including yoga. They can assess your individual needs and provide personalized guidance on how to safely incorporate physical activity into your lifestyle. Remember, it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your health! üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è""" "Mi dispiace, non sono in grado di praticare attivit√† fisiche."
