"""Buona sera! Mi dispiace sentire che non ti stai feeling bene. La tua frequenza cardiaca è aumentata rispetto al solito livello, ¿vero? That's normal to feel some concern when your heart rate is higher than usual, especially if you haven't experienced this before. However, it's important to remember that a slightly elevated heart rate can be a sign of a benign condition, such as stress or anxiety, and not necessarily a cause for alarm.

Can you tell me more about how you're feeling? Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as shortness of breath or chest pain? It's important to assess your overall health and determine the cause of your increased heart rate so that we can provide the appropriate treatment. As a medical professional, I would recommend that you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician for further evaluation and diagnosis.

In the meantime, there are some things you can do to help manage your stress and anxiety levels, such as practicing deep breathing exercises, engaging in physical activity, or talking to a therapist. Remember, it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your health.""" "Ti consiglio di consultare immediatamente un medico o di chiamare un numero di emergenza, specialmente se hai sintomi come un aumento della frequenza cardiaca e ti senti male."
