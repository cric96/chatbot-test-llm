"""  Certainly! As a healthcare professional, I recommend incorporating yoga into your daily routine to improve your overall well-being and reduce stress on your body. Yoga can help lower blood pressure and heart rate, while also improving flexibility and balance. However, it's essential to consult with your primary care physician before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions. They can help you determine the best yoga practices for your individual needs and abilities.""" "Mi dispiace, non sono in grado di praticare attivit√† fisiche."
